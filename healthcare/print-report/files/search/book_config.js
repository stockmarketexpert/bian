Such dexterity requires experience. That is, experience in the complex dynamics of healthcare delivery, payment and regulation, paired with a lens wide enough to see every corner of the market, from every corner of the globe.With more than three decades of experience, our firm has seen firsthand how evolving regulatory and payer dynamics, trends in medical practice, technology and new consumer models are shaping the future of healthcare. Bain Capital pursues that future by pairing local market expertise with the power of a global platform, and by matching those insights to the broadest array of healthcare opportunities—from biotech and pharmaceuticals to home health delivery, managed care and the technology solutions that support the ecosystem. And drawing upon our experience in everything from carve-outs and take-privates to minority investments and growth equity, the Bain Capital team pairs the right structure to the right opportunity.“They’re great business people,” said Tony Coles, CEO of portfolio company Cerevel. “They really understand the long-term.

That’s why, with every healthcare investment, Bain Capital focuses on opportunities to drive transformational growth.It’s a pursuit that requires relentless inquiry, the will to challenge conventional thinking, and the wherewithal to turn ideas into action. It’s how molecules become therapeutic breakthroughs, how technology becomes a value creator and, ultimately, how capital becomes cash flow.Of course, transformation isn’t about change for its own sake.

That philosophy is central to our investment strategy.In making healthcare investments, Bain Capital operates on a simple premise: the greatest value is created by improving the quality of care for patients and healthcare consumers. Explicitly tracking outcomes and tying operational improvements to quality care means the firm can both measure results and best ensure those results create durable, sustainable businesses.A key focus at the Board level is making sure that the company understands what the right quality metrics are, and that we’re consistently measuring and constantly improving on those.Andrew KaplanPartner, Bain Capital Private EquityFirst and foremost, Bain Capital brings a patient perspective to every decision made.Mark CaputoChairman & CEO, U.S. Renal Care We’re vested in improving clinical outcomes, which will then lead to a stronger value proposition and help make the company thrive.

This means prioritizing patient care, creating positive working environments, and being responsive to payers and regulators. When you meet the needs of all these groups, this leads to great investment outcomes.Peter SpringPartner, Bain Capital Double Impact  ","A ‘Virtuous Cycle’for EmployeesExcellent healthcare starts with excellent people. Bain Capital builds companies with the conviction that the key to strong business and patient outcomes is people throughout the organization.The COVID-19 crisis drove home the impact that dedicated, talented people can have on the wellbeing of a population, from the frontline healthcare workers delivering care to the most vulnerable, to pharmaceutical R&D teams racing to develop a game-changing vaccine. Healthcare skills at all levels of the industry are in finite supply, and so the ability to attract and retain the best talent can mean the difference between merely participating in a healthcare sector and leading it. As such, when Bain Capital makes a new investment, one of our first moves is to ensure a senior focus on employees by empowering the Chief Human Resources Officer, creating a trickle-down awareness that people are the center of the plan for growth. “We need to make sure that we’re investing in a place people want to work, a place that motivates people to develop and stay over time and mentor their successors,” says Chris Gordon, Co-Head of Bain Capital’s North American Private Equity business and Global Head of Healthcare. “Those people create value in the business, the business grows, and then you need more people. And so it’s a virtuous cycle. That’s how you can really create talent as a strategic advantage.”Working with the team at Bain Capital over the past few years has been fantastic. They care deeply about the needs of our frontline staff and lead with humanity, finding creative solutions to challenges and always putting the wellbeing of our patients first.Janene, LCSWSocial Worker Gallup, New Mexico Dialysis Facility, U.S. Renal CareThrough a successful, growth-focused approach, Bain Capital and Surgery Partners have demonstrated their commitment to a strong partnership.

In 2013, it was losing money, on a downward trajectory, and owned by the UK’s Department of Health.Despite lackluster performance, the company provided roughly one-third of UK plasma-derived therapeutics and sold products around the world. It already had a division in the U.S. to collect plasma donations. In conducting due diligence, Bain Capital tapped the experts at our own portfolio company, HCA. We learned that plasma-derived products, used primarily to treat immunological disorders, were in short supply in the U.S. “Companies big and small were looking for alternative providers relative to a few big players in this space,” says Devin O’Reilly, Partner and Head of North America for Bain Capital Private Equity’s Healthcare Vertical. “That gave us confidence that, even though we were a small player, we could make headway with BPL’s differentiated products, as well as the right distribution and marketing strategy.”Bain Capital ended up buying 80 percent of the business. We drew upon our experience in international expansion to help BPL further penetrate the U.S. market. HCA itself became a customer of BPL’s plasma products, and the company’s fortunes quickly improved as other U.S. hospitals and clinics followed suit. The company was sold three years later for roughly four times the original investment amount.“We have transformed BPL into a growth company by investing in people, production capacity, and new products,” says Ben Kunstler, Partner at Bain Capital Private Equity. Ultimately, we have increased supply and introduced new therapies to better serve patients.”18Bain Capital  HealthcareNew Blood,New OpportunityInternational expansion led to a quick turnaround for Bio Products Laboratory  Bio Products Laboratory: Quick FactsOVERVIEWCollect plasma and safely process it for medical products.

And, second, could Bain Capital start a world-class neuroscience company from scratch?For patients suffering from devastating neurological disorders such as Parkin-sons disease, epilepsy, and schizophre-nia, the answers, thankfully, were “yes.” Diseases of the nervous system have long been of interest to the firm. “One of the reasons for that interest is that it’s been a difficult area in which to develop drugs,” explains Chris Gordon, Co-Head of Bain Capital’s North Ameri-can Private Equity business and Global Head of Healthcare. “It’s a little counter-intuitive, but the reason it’s an area of interest is that because of the challeng-es, it’s been an underserved area.”Not only that, but drug development also plays to one of the firm’s distinguishing strengths: the combination of investment acumen and scientific expertise.Building the Right TeamPfizer believed in the drugs, but deemed neurological disorders a “non-core” business, and sought a partner that could help bring these promising compounds to market. Having already partnered with Pfizer on the successful launch of SpringWorks (see next page), Bain Capital proposed a new—and novel—partnership. “We were approached by well over 100 entities wanting to work with us,” remembers Morris Birnbaum, Former Chief Scientific Officer of Internal Medicine at Pfizer. “Perhaps one of the most unusual opportunities was when Bain Capital approached us with the idea of spinning out a new company, taking advantage of all those assets.”“You don’t often see private equity invest in noncommercial pharma companies because the nature of pharmaceutical research is that it’s high risk,” says Marjin Dekkers, Chairman of Novalis LifeSciences and a Cerevel board member. “It’s the domain expertise of the Life Sciences group with the carve-out expertise of Bain Capital Private Equity that creates this very unique situation.”Pfizer also wanted to continue playing a role in developing the drugs, therefore choosing a firm with an established record of partnership was paramount.So, in 2018, Bain Capital and Pfizer joined forces once again, and the hard work of building Cerevel Therapeutics began.A Start Up (with a Leg Up)“We got the opportunity to start from the very beginning,” says Tony Coles, Cerevel’s Chief Executive Officer. “We’ve 21Bain Capital  Healthcare","got great molecules that will eventually become new medicines. We’re able to attract some of the best talent to take care of these assets and deliver them to patients to really help them and to have their lives improve.”“We didn’t have a name, we didn’t have office space,” remembers Blair Hendrix, a Partner in Bain Capital Private Equity’s Portfolio Group. “We had 11 clinical and preclinical programs and the right to develop them. We brought in people from our Portfolio Group to help build a new business infrastructure. Not many firms can tackle something like that.”The firm’s Portfolio Group is a key contributor in many investments. In the case of Cerevel, they worked with the investment team to rapidly create the infrastructure to support a world-class biopharmaceutical business. This included securing appropriate space, installing IT and finance systems, and recruiting leaders for key roles in clinical development, science, finance, and human resources—what Coles refers to as “the best, A+ talent that’s in the industry.”With those pieces in place, Bain Capital Life Sciences, our partners at Pfizer, and the Cerevel team focused on advancing the pipeline.From Concept to RealityCerevel compounds have made important progress in clinical trials. Since going public in 2020, Cerevel has shown exciting data in both schizophrenia and anxiety, with multiple trial read outs in its late-stage pipeline in 2023 and 2024. This momentum has enabled Cerevel to raise over $1.7B in capital since inception.“Great businesses are built because of great teams,” notes Adam Koppel, a Partner with Bain Capital Life Sciences. “Bain Capital is uniquely positioned to partner with the biopharmaceutical industry because of our deep content knowledge, our business building experience, our balance sheet and, most importantly, our culture of partnership, which creates the most value for investors—and for patients.”PIPELINE PROGRESSHow Cerevel’s clinical trials targeting major diseases are moving forwardCompoundDisease AreaDiscoveryPre-clinicalPhase 1Phase 2Phase 3 MechanismEmraclidineSchizophrenia / PsychosisM4 PAMDarigabatEpilepsyGABA a2/3/5 PAMDarigabatPanic DisorderGABA a2/3/5 PAMTavapadonEarly Parkinson’sD1/D5 Strong Partial AgonistTavapadonLate Parkinson’sD1/D5 Strong Partial AgonistCVL-871Dementia-Related ApathyD1/D5 Partial AgonistOther ProgramsCVL-354MDD / Substance Use DisorderKOR AntagonistCVL-047MDD/ SchizophreniaPDE4 InhibitorM4 AgonistSchizophrenia/ PsychosisM4 AgonistLRRK2 InhibitorParkinson’sLRRK2 Inhibitor22Bain Capital  Healthcare","One of Bain Capital Life Sciences’ earliest investments was SpringWorks, a partnership with Pfizer, OrbiMed, Li-feArc and Bain Capital Double Impact. Pfizer engaged with Bain Capital to discuss a common challenge pharma companies face: strong assets that are no longer a corporate fit, which in this case were products focused on rare and orphan conditions with an unmet need. “We worked with Pfizer to review potential assets while also creating a shared vision for a company that would advance those programs in a way Pfizer couldn’t achieve itself or through more classic out-licensing activities,” said Jef-frey Schwartz, a Partner at Bain Capital Life Sciences. The result was Spring-Works, which took multiple stalled pro-grams and quickly restarted them. The company has built a robust platform for pursuing targeted oncology thera-peutics and has completed multiple partnerships to further advance assets to serve patients. Springworks reported positive clinical data in 2022 for its lead asset nirogacestat, a treatment for des-moid tumors and anticipates getting regulatory approval and commercializ-ing the product in 2023, representing the first approval of a pharmaceutical for this disease.When Bain Capital Life Sciences considered the opportunity to invest in Dicerna in 2017, it found a com-pany with a promising technology and a complicated backstory. Publicly traded Dicerna, which pursues RNA interference technology to “turn off” disease-causing genes, had seen its valuation plummet due to a decision to shift its pipeline to a next-generation delivery technology and the overhang of a significant lawsuit brought by a competitor. The team was impressed by Dicerna’s revamped pipeline and dove deep into the lawsuit’s particu-lars before putting the full force and reputation of the Bain Capital platform behind the company. Ultimately, Bain Capital partnered with the company leadership to accomplish a $70M investment round and joined Dicerna’s Board of Directors. “It’s not often that you lead a capital raise that is larger than the company’s market cap,” notes Adam Koppel, a Partner with Bain Capital Life Sciences. Since the in-vestment, the company has advanced multiple clinical programs, completed multiple scale partnerships with large pharma and settled the litigation, all of which have led to Dicerna’s market cap increasing eight-fold.Like Cerevel, Kestra was a vision in search of the right commercial plan. In 2016, Kestra was a division of Physio-Control, a medical device company in the Bain Capital Private Equity portfolio, and was working on a new type of wearable defibrillator for high-risk cardiac patients. When Physio-Control was sold to Stryker, Bain Capital decided that Kestra would better develop as an independent company. “We believed in the vision of the product but knew it would take several more years to come to fruition,” says JP Chilazi, a Principal on the Bain Capital Private Equity team. Bain Capital Life Sciences then teamed with Bain Capital Private Equity to invest over $250M to complete the development and roll-out of the groundbreaking defibrillator, which successfully received FDA approval in 2021. BAIN CAPITAL LIFE SCIENCES INVESTMENTSA Running StartIn just a few years, Bain Capital Life Sciences has brought the firm’s distinct advantages to a broad range of investments. The team has invested in over 50 companies driving innovation in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices, diagnostics, and life sciences tools. Examples from our portfolio include:23Bain Capital  Healthcare","Today, the more than $100 billion HCIT market in the U.S. is at an inflectio point n, growing at an accelerating rate as healthcare participants continue to adopt new technologies and applications to automate every aspect of their workflow from HR to operations to billing, scheduling, clinical trials, customer engagement, care management, telemedicine and consumer online shopping.These growth tailwinds present an enormous opportunity for HCIT innovators solving key healthcare challenges through data, analytics, AI and technology. As a veteran investor in healthcare and technology, Bain Capital has been a leader in HCIT investing for over a decade – supporting more than 35 of the most innovative and disruptive companies in the sector.Our history of collaboration across our healthcare and technology verticals and between our Private Equity, Tech Opportunities and Venture businesses, coupled with the many operational and business-building resources available to Bain Capital portfolio companies, has led to deep intellectual property development and disruptive innovation across the HCIT value chain.Our most successful investments in the HCIT space build on both imagination and collaboration. Imagination, in that we have in some cases completely re-platformed the companies we have invested in, often through transformative mergers. Collaboration, in that the Bain Capital team has tapped expertise from across our platform to bring together the best of later-stage business-building capabilities and early-stage technology insights to produce market-leading companies. Bain Capital’s experience in the space has contributed to the development of our exceptional HCIT companies and the ongoing efforts to improve healthcare delivery around the world.Healthcare ITOver the last several years – healthcare technology (HCIT) has become an integral part of the solutions powering our healthcare ecosystem, as payers, providers, pharma companies and con-sumers have embraced the transformative benefits that technol-ogy can bring to improving cost, access and quality of care.More HCIT investment highlights","25Bain Capital  HealthcareWe have long invested in the healthcare and software verticals and have deep domain expertise in both. Across the Waystar journey, we have been able to leverage our significant cross-vertical IP and capabilities in several strategic functions including M&A integration, product innovation, channel strategy design and digital marketing, supporting management to accelerate the development of its offerings and bookings growth trajectory.At the forefront of the digital transformation in healthcare in the U.S. is athenahealth. Bain capital believes athenahealth has an exceptional competitive position and is well positioned as the long-term winner and consolidator in its space. As the partner of choice, Bain Capital is able to draw upon several platform synergies to support the investment, including partnership opportunities in our portfolio portfolio, an extensive network across the healthcare ecosystem, a strong HCIT talent pool and a well-honed approach to GTM and strategic M&A acceleration building on the successes at Waystar and Zelis.In 2019, healthcare payments company Zelis was scaling rapidly. It was ready to take a transformative next step: a merger with RedCard Systems that would create the healthcare industry’s first next-generation, vertically-integrated payment technology leader. To navigate the complex merger, Zelis knew it would need a partner with the financial wherewithal required to fund a multi-billion dollar transaction, the value-added portfolio capabilities required to support transformative M&A integration and the HCIT payments expertise required to drive the next chapter of innovation for the company. Zelis chose Bain Capital because these are our strengths.","26Bain Capital  HealthcareBranching OutWhen Bain Capital looked for new opportunities, we ventured to less familiar territory: Brazil  When Bain Capital professionals first arrived in Brazil, we were often asked, “What are you doing down here?”In 2008, private equity activity in Brazil was scarce, with investors shying away from the untapped but complex market. At the same time, Bain Capital decided to leverage our experience investing in U.S. hospitals and in complex, cross-border investments by finding opportunities in countries with similar market dynamics.Brazil, it turned out, ranked very high on the list. “After spending a lot of time there, we saw all the same kinds of private-market analogs we’ve been successful with in the U.S.,” says Chris Gordon, Co-Head of Bain Capital’s North American Private Equity business and Global Head of Healthcare. Among those similarities was a market that relied heavily on private insurance. We soon were introduced to GNDI, a market leader serving millions of patients in São Paulo. What made GNDI unique? It was both the provider and the insurer, delivering care through a captive network of healthcare providers and facilities, allowing for coordinated, high-quality and cost-effective care.To drive the operating plan of the business, Bain Capital not only recruited a new CEO, but also sent Michel Freund, a Partner with the North American Private Equity team’s Portfolio Group, to São Paulo to work alongside GNDI’s new management team. “There were a lot of operational challenges post-acquisition, as this was a founder-based organization that needed to be transformed into a fully professional world-class organization,” Freund says. “The portfolio team could then work and support the company in building an internal capacity for M&A, while also driving growth strategy and operating improvements.”In a three-year period, GNDI completed eight acquisitions. The team also knew that patients viewed GNDI more as a low-cost provider rather than one that delivered high-quality care. Changing that perception became a key component of the long-term value-creation plan, so in addition to making big investments in caregivers and facilities, GNDI launched a major marketing campaign.“It took a few years,” says Gordon, “but if you go talk to people in Brazil now, GNDI is perceived as very high quality and good value, not just the cheapest option.”The surge in customer satisfaction was accompanied by significant gains in market share, yet another effect of the expanded go-to-market efforts. Bain Capital and GNDI management sought to replicate its success beyond São Paulo. GNDI’s significant growth trajectory has continued since its 2018 IPO, creating value for both patients and shareholders. In 2022, GNDI merged with Hapvida to form Latin America’s largest vertically integrated healthcare provider and insurer.GNDI: Quick FactsOVERVIEWMarket-leading integrated provider of health and dental plans in Brazil, serving thousands of companies and millions of membersHQSão Paulo, BrazilINVESTMENT2014INVESTORSBain Capital Private EquityWEBSITEwww.gndi.com.br","Patients Come First Partnering with founders is one of Bain Capital’s most common investment types. Although GNDI’s founder, Dr. Paulo Sérgio Barbanti, was not ready to sell when he first met with the firm, we bonded over a shared vision of how healthcare should be delivered. “He was a healthcare wonk, and so are we,” says Gordon. “When he finally got to the point where he was ready to sell, he actually chose to partner with us at a lower value than a competing proposal because he believed we would be the best stewards of his life’s work.”Bain Capital acquired GNDI for R$1.6 billion. As of March 2022, following the merger with Hapvida, the combined company had a market capitalization of approximately R$85 billion.27Bain Capital  HealthcareBENEFICIARIES IN 2014BENEFICIARIES IN 2022Primarily serving Brazil’s middle class2.4M7.6MDriving Access to Quality Care","28Bain Capital  HealthcarePartner of ChoiceThe privatization of hospital chain HCA allowed the business to focus on long-term growth and value creation United StatesUnited KingdomHCA Healthcare: Quick FactsOVERVIEWLeading healthcare provider with 186 hospitals across the U.S. and UKHQNashville, TNINVESTMENT2006INVESTORSBain Capital Private EquityWEBSITEwww.hcahealthcare.comTOTAL ADMISSIONS (2007 - 2015)MEDICAID ADMISSIONS (2007 - 2015)+44%+20%Driving Access to Quality Care","29Bain Capital  HealthcareThe 2006 take-private of HCA remains one of the largest private equity investments of all time and, for Bain Capital’s investors, one of the most profitable. Bain Capital had a long relationship with HCA’s founders, the Frist family, which helped shape a nuanced view of the hospital chain’s performance and long-term prospects. These insights led to the conclusion that HCA, which was then a public company, was undervalued. Investors mispriced HCA for two main reasons: too much focus on quarterly revenue and admissions volatility, and not enough appreciation for the decades-long work the Frists had done to make HCA’s hospitals critical, high-quality components of the healthcare delivery system in many urban markets. Seeing the compelling value in HCA’s network of leading hospitals and its high-quality approach to care delivery, we developed a plan to privatize HCA and allow the company to focus on growth and long-term value creation.In 2006, Bain Capital, the Frists, and two equity partners purchased the company in a $33B take-private.Under private ownership, company leadership preserved the culture of strong local hospital management, but were also able to invest in system-wide tools and technology to drive quality, growth and operating efficiency. These efforts allowed HCA to grow its employee base and deliver high-quality care to larger numbers of patients while improving operating margins. At the time, many healthcare companies were also still struggling to transition from paper to digital. With help from Bain Capital Private Equity’s Portfolio Group, HCA also made a major investment in IT infrastructure.“By 2011, the company really had a focused strategy and a different financial trajectory to articulate to the public markets,” says Chris Gordon, a Co-Head of Bain Capital’s North American Private Equity business and Global Head of Healthcare. “It used to be perceived as being in the wrong part of the market with volatile statistics. Now it was received as being in the right part of the market with strong growth and differential operating capabilities.”That year, the company was re-listed on the public markets, raising $3.79 billion, representing the biggest private equity-backed IPO in history.Frist Fundamentals In many ways, the Frist family’s decision to take HCA private in 2006 was faithful to the origins of what has become America’s most-respected for-profit hospital business. HCA was founded in 1968 by two doctors, Thomas Frist Sr. and Thomas Frist Jr., and prototypical U.S. venture capitalist Jack Massey. The mission was to build a scalable healthcare business that put patients first. Fast forward 38 years, and the Frist family again sought to pair medical expertise with cutting-edge business practices. Since its re-IPO, the company has added roughly $100 to its price per share while also doubling down on its commitment to community support, including providing some $3.7 billion in free care to uninsured patients in 2019.","30Bain Capital  HealthcareDoing Well,Doing GoodThis Durham, North Carolina-based company provides in-home personal care aides to help elderly people live better, safer lives at home and reduce avoidable accidents which can lead to hospitalizations or other expensive medical procedures. At the same time, the company has made it a priority to support its workforce through training programs, better benefits, and career advancement opportunities. The company’s mission is to “attract, train, retain and treasure the best care professionals,” and in doing so achieve superior financial and impact outcomes.“The CEO and founder really was passionate about creating better jobs,” says Spring. “He saw that Bain Capital shared this mission, and that was a key reason he partnered with us.”Bain Capital Double Impact grew out of a long history of responsible investing within our business units, and reflects the values of the firm as a wholeFormed in 2018, the Bain Capital Double Impact team explicitly targets investments that they believe will achieve great returns and measurable environmental and social impact.“Our goal is to achieve outstanding investment outcomes utilizing Bain Capital’s value-added approach,” says Peter Spring, a Partner who crossed over from Bain Capital Private Equity to lead Health & Wellness investing at Double Impact. “In addition to driving commercial success, we are seeking to take that same hands-on approach to drive initiatives that will benefit all stakeholders, including patients, employees, and payers.”Healthcare, with its broad societal impact, has tremendous potential for an impact-focused approach. While Double Impact’s mandate can encompass much of the healthcare ecosystem, the team has prioritized opportunities that have a disproportionate benefit to underserved and vulnerable patient populations.","31Bain Capital  HealthcareBroadstep Behavioral Health provides a range of services for children and adults  services was the key driver behind with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) including housing support, work training and enrichment. As with Arosa, care professional training and career development is a key focus. Bain Capital Double Impact also seeks growth through add-on acquisitions, and we have the in-house operating expertise to help with merger integration. Our goal is always to improve the services provided and clinical outcomes.“Our patients, our people who support them, our state agencies, our communities—they are reflective of the mosaic of this country,” says Lynn Mason, CEO of Broadstep. “I want them to see themselves reflected in us, and diversity of thought also helps us solve problems faster, challenge each other, and provides us with new perspectives.”Improving patient access to healthcare the acquisition of HealthDrive, which provides skilled nursing facilities with on-site physician services in the specialty areas of podiatry, dentistry, audiology, optometry and behavioral health. Providing services on-site and at regular intervals vastly improves adherence to recommended preventative treatment plans, which have been shown to improve quality of life and reduce potentially devastating conditions such as pneumonia or accidental falls. Double Impact kicked off the growth of the business with the add-on acquisition of New England Geriatrics (NEG). “The NEG acquisition was a great example of Bain Capital’s differentiation in the market,” said Klaus Koenigshauen, Partner at Bain Capital Double Impact. “We were able to identify a new service line that HealthDrive’s customers were demanding and close a meaningful add-on acquisition that created financial value right out of the gate.”This Texas-based dental practice was founded by three dentists who wanted to reimagine how dental services could be provided to low-income children, who often lacked access to care. This deeply mission-oriented team believed in providing not just high-quality care, but also a “high-end” experience. The company tapped Bain Capital Double Impact to help them scale this unique, customer-centric model to become a leading national player. The firm’s experience in multi-site healthcare, multi-site retail and consumer brand development were critical factors in the founders giving Bain Capital an exclusive period to conduct due diligence and develop a partnership.","China’s healthcare system is dominated by publicly owned hospitals, many of which have long histories and academic bents. After years observing that market, Bain Capital saw an opportunity to invest in a company that delivered care in a “more targeted, efficient manner,” according to Jonathan Zhu, a Partner at Bain Capital Private Equity.The result, built up carefully over time, has been APMG, a leading private hospital chain made possible by Bain Capital’s deep research, local expertise, connections, and experience in the hospitals sector. In addition to studying China’s healthcare payments system and hospital ecosystem, Bain Capital brought a long history of growing private hospital businesses in other markets, such as HCA in the U.S. and GNDI in Brazil. “We did a lot of work to map out the landscape and were then able to draw on our experience in other markets to help us understand how the Chinese market was likely to evolve,” says Zhu.That global track record, combined with on-the-ground credibility in China, helped APMG’s management team pursue several partnerships with public hospitals to expand some of its most successful service lines, like neurology and oncology. Bain Capital’s strong relationship network also led to a string of acquisitions.In 2017, APMG had the opportunity to acquire two hospitals from CHC Healthcare, a hospitals group founded by the Frist family, which had also founded HCA, a seminal Bain Capital hospital investment. The Frists chose to partner again with Bain Capital.APMG is now working on its ninth hospital, a greenfield asset currently under development. The focus on underserved specialties is also paying off. For example, APMG has the number-one hospital in China for Gamma Knife surgery, a complicated brain tumor treatment. To date, it has performed more than 30,000 procedures. Using a baseball analogy, Zhu estimates that APMG’s market penetration is probably in the “third to fourth inning.”Patient Capital in ChinaBain Capital combined many strengths to transform and grow a private hospital chain in the world’s largest healthcare marketAPMG: Quick FactsOVERVIEWLeading private hospital group in ChinaHQBeijing, ChinaINVESTMENT2016INVESTORSBain Capital Private Equity32Bain Capital  Healthcare","Bain Capital has leveraged our deep expertise in the hospital business in four notable transactions across three continents, demonstrating the firm’s global capabilities and determination to apply winning business models across markets.Following the public-to-private-to-public success of HCA in North America, Bain Capital saw an opportunity to change patient perceptions and win market share in Brazil with GNDI.Back in the U.S., Bain Capital invested in Surgery Partners to improve outpatient surgery centers in a way that delivers better care at better pricing, a difficult-to-achieve balance learned through years of hard-won experience.In the case of APMG, Bain Capital saw an opportunity to build an innovative, patient-focused hospital platform in the dynamic Chinese hospital market. The appeal of the APMG platform led to a second opportunity to partner with the Frist family when they merged their nascent Chinese hospital business into APMG. This combination was an important building block in creating the leading private hospital group in China.Bain Capital is not done building hospitals.

In partnership with a local life sciences developer, Bain Capital created the Genesis brand and R&D real estate platform eight years ago to build and retrofit properties in the top innovation hubs of the Bay Area, San Diego and Boston. Genesis Trapelo, a 68,000 square-foot lab space in Waltham, Massachusetts, acquired off-market in 2019, was fully refurbished to meet the flexible needs of life sciences tenants, and was fully pre-leased in December 2020 before the expected delivery in early 2021. “There are very few teams that can match Genesis’ deep experience in the life sciences industry coupled with our extensive history converting office buildings to lab” says Joe Marconi, a Partner on the Bain Capital Real Estate team. “You need the expertise, the relationships, and the reputation to effectively partner and deliver an environment that helps accelerate these companies’ discovery.”A benefit not shared by most of our competitors is the collaboration with our Private Equity and Life Sciences teams. Their extensive knowledge of the participants in the healthcare universe often provides the Genesis platform insights on changing company desires and industry evolution.34Bain Capital  Healthcare","Bain Capital Real Estate has monetized some of the early Genesis real estate investments. Most prominently, in October 2020, it sold Genesis South San Francisco, in the San Francisco Cluster, to Ventas, a public REIT, for $1 billion.Genesis South San Francisco was a three-building portfolio that included one of the tallest life sciences properties in the world. The project began with an off-market acquisition of a failed office project consisting of an existing 12-story building and a 21-story abandoned development site. Upon acquiring a third building, completing the repositioning of the existing buildings and the construction of the tower, the three-building project encompassed almost 800,000 square feet of Class A, highly amenitized lab space. “Strong and growing capital flows into the life sciences sector are accelerating innovation and discovery,” Ventas Chairman and CEO Debra Cafaro said in a statement. “These flows support the demand for first-class lab space.”Genesis South San FranciscoRight Assets, REIT Exit35Bain Capital  Healthcare","36Bain Capital  Healthcare“Forward-Looking Pharmacists”At 122 years old, Germany-based STADA’s global business got a big boost from a global platformSTADA’s Busy Private Years•  Delists•  Acquires EMEA rights to anti-dandruff brand Nizoral•  Moves into biosimilars space with investment in BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG•  Goes large in skin-care with acquisition of OTC portfolio from GSK•  Launches Biosimilar Movymia targeting osteoporosis•  Launches Bortezomib injectable anti-cancer drug•  Acquires Walmark, a consumer-facing company in Central Europe•  Invests in Takeda201820192020Bio Products Laboratory: Quick FactsOVERVIEWEuropean manufacturer of prescription generics and over-the-counter medicine across more than 120 marketsHQFrankfurt, GermanyINVESTMENT2017INVESTORSBain Capital Private EquityWEBSITEwww.stada.com","37Bain Capital  HealthcareBy 2017, after two world wars and decades of pan-European expansion, STADA’s business was vast, idiosyncratic, geographically siloed, riven with legacy practices and structures, and in need of significant investment.Following years of activist agitation, the 122-year-old company selected Bain Capital and a consortium partner to take the company private and reposition the provider of generic and over-the-counter medicines for growth.“Our European colleagues had spent many years building relationships and understanding the local pharmaceutical  partnered with management to drive markets,” says Andrew Kaplan, a Partner on the North American Private Equity team. “The U.S. team brought a deep understanding of the market for generics and how those markets were likely to evolve over time.”Bain Capital’s roadmap to success for STADA included a blueprint to focus on top-line growth and margin improvement.

But midway through the investment, Bain Capital helped the company to also become a major provider of data to the global pharmaceutical industry, and helped to propel the pharmaceutical industry in the process.Founded in 1982, by 2008 Quintiles had become the leading global contract research organization, a provider of outsourced clinical trials to the pharmaceutical industry. It also had a smaller business providing outsourced pharmaceutical sales teams. The growth was driven in part by the tailwind of an industry moving toward more variable cost structures but also by a strong trend toward globalization of clinical development programs.  Quintiles had made significant investments in its global footprint, which created significant strategic differentiation. In addition, pharmaceuticals were being transformed by the growing prominence of biotech companies, which are heavier users of outsourced clinical trial management than traditional large pharmaceutical companies. Bain Capital had a vision of being a partner to a company that was positioned better than any other to benefit from these trends.Quintiles’ founder, Dennis Gillings, and his original investor group had begun to think about ways of growing beyond the core CRO business.

The core thesis behind the transaction and the newly combined platform was that value to patients, providers, pharmaceutical companies and the overall healthcare ecosystem could be created through the blending of clinical trial and real world data in an integrated platform. Quintiles, by now a public company, merged with IMS in 2013 and was renamed IQVIA. The fully integrated and synergized company has built one of the world’s largest portfolios of healthcare information, with deep therapeutic, domain, regulatory and commercial analytic expertise. “We were able to do something that the pharmaceutical companies couldn’t do for themselves, which was to use data to recognize how trials can be enrolled more quickly, and then, ultimately, to finish earlier—to bring drugs to market in a much more rapid fashion,” says John Connaughton, a Co-Managing Partner of Bain Capital and Global Head of its private equity business.During the COVID crisis, IQVIA’s team has also led in dis-seminating information and working closely with custom-ers to alleviate the disruption of clinical trials. From the company’s IPO in 2013 to Bain Capital’s exit in 2021, IQVIA added nearly $1 billion in EBITDA and doubled revenue.“The company has continued to grow on a nice trajectory and has been able to leverage that data footprint to have a more compelling CRO offering and vice versa,” says Gordon.We were able to do something that the pharmaceutical companies couldn’t do for themselves, which was to use data to recognize how trials can be enrolled more quickly, and then, ultimately, to finish earlier to bring drugs —to market in a much more rapid fashion.John ConnaughtonCo-Managing Partner  and Global Head of Private Equity, Bain Capital43Bain Capital  Healthcare","44Bain Capital  HealthcareLife for families with children or adults suffering from debilitating medical disorders is difficult enough—long, expensive hospital stays can make it unbearable.So, in 2017, Bain Capital partnered with the leadership of PSA Healthcare to form Aveanna Healthcare with the conviction that a major investment in quality nursing and point-of-care technology would result in better, more affordable, and more personalized care for those who need it most.To create Aveanna, Bain Capital merged two homecare businesses and embarked on a journey of transformational growth. Five years later, with 30,000 caregivers across 25 states, we have built the country’s largest provider of in-home pediatric care.“It’s very important to give these children an opportunity to go to school, to thrive, but to be able to live at home,” says Paul Moskowitz, a Managing Director on Bain Capital’s Private Equity team. “Aveanna is the bedrock of that care continuum.”The ChallengeAveanna focuses on one of healthcare’s most challenging patient populations: some 60,000 children with conditions such as cerebral palsy and spina bifida.

While pediatric home care has long been an option for vulnerable young patients, Bain Capital and PSA saw an opportunity to bring greater scale, systems, technology and professionalism to the business—the home care provider of the future. The SolutionAveanna has built the largest pediatric PDN-focused training program in the country, creating a staff large and flexible enough to provide care wherever and whenever it’s needed, and focusing on technology to give nurses the ability to share patient records with doctors in real time.It’s win-win: nurses get high-quality training, flexible work arrangements and the ability to create long-term care relationships with families. Parents receive flexible, quality, affordable care for their children. And the patients enjoy better lives.The ResultAveanna’s impact on patients has been a success story. The company has become a trusted partner for discharge planners, helping to quickly and smoothly facilitate transition to the home. Hospital re-admittances, which often result when children don’t have access to quality care at home, have also decreased.Already, Bain Capital has expanded Aveanna’s winning combination to new states and care to other patient populations, including seniors. “The ability to deliver care in the home at a cost point of hundreds of dollars per day, as opposed to several thousands of dollars per day, is delivering enormous ROI back to society,” Moskowitz says. “It’s a perfect example of creating value where everybody wins.”PATIENTS IN 2016PATIENTS IN 20203.2KDriving Access to Quality

No securities commission or regulatory authority in the United States or in any other country has in any way passed upon the merits of an investment in a Bain Capital investment vehicle or the accuracy or adequacy of the information or material contained herein or otherwise.This written material provides a general introduction to Bain Capital and its business and is intended for your sole use. It should not be relied upon as the basis for making any investment decision, entering into any transaction or for any other purpose.Bain Capital, its subsidiaries and affiliates and its and their respective employees, officers and agents make no representations as to the completeness and accuracy of any information contained within this written material.

Bain Capital and its affiliates act for the funds and investment vehicles which they manage or advise (the “Funds”) and will not be acting for anyone else.  In particular, Bain Capital will not advise potential investors on subscriptions in any Fund or co-investments and will not arrange transactions on behalf of anyone other than the Funds or provide advice on the merits of such transactions.

Bain Capital is not responsible for providing you with the protections afforded to its clients and you are strongly advised to take your own legal, investment and tax advice from suitably qualified advisers.An investment in the Funds is speculative and involves a high degree of risk, which may not be suitable for all investors. The Funds may often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss and the investments may be highly illiquid. The Funds are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investing in the Funds may involve complex tax structure, and there may be delays in distributing important tax information. Private funds are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, and private fund advisers and sponsors often charge high fees.  An investment in the Funds involves a number of significant risks and other important factors relating to investments in limited partnerships generally, and relating to the structure and investment objectives of a given Fund in particular. Investors should consider risks associated with the following: illiquidity and restrictions on transfer; tax considerations; valuation risks, and impact of fees on returns. The foregoing list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration of the risks involved in an investment in the Funds. Prospective investors should reference the offering document and consult with their own legal, tax and financial advisors before deciding to invest in the Funds. Refer to a particular Fund’s private placement memorandum for additional details, risk factors and other important considerations, including registration requirements for certain jurisdictions.
